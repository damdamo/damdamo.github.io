Hello !
I'm Damien and I decided to create my own website.
Why ? Because I just want to share my passion about Computer Science !
I can share you my research, different kind of tutorial to enhance your (and my) knowledge on a particular subject, or just my opinion.

Here some social network where you can find me:
