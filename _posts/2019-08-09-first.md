Hello!
I am Damien and I decided to create my own website.
Why? Because I just want to share my passion of computer science!
Here I will share insights of my research, different kinds of tutorials and tips to enhance your (and my) knowledge on particular subjects, or (sometimes) simply just my opinion.

You can also find me on these social networks:
